  <h2>About Me</h2>
  I took my first coding class when I was almost 20. Initially, I was majoring in Economics and
  Environmental Science and only enrolled in SI 106 because knowledge in Python would be useful
  in my chosen fields. I fell in love with coding and saw that technology can revolutionize
  many other fields. So I decided to study Computer Science (Sad that I'm graduating a year later
  but overall, I love solving problems with my newfound skills), but I still hope to combine my
  interest of environmental economics with software engineering.

  <h2>How To Set Up A Personal Website At The University Of Michigan</h2>

  <h3>This is a basic how to make your own web page and hosting it on UM servers using my experience
  making this website (this is just one way to do it- using the terminal). As a CS student, I had some trouble
  understanding the instructions so hopefully this will help. </h3>

  There are at least three UM departments that host websites:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.umich.edu/~umweb/how-to/homepage.html">IT</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.eecs.umich.edu/dco/kb/How+do+I+create+a+website+on+the+EECS+web+server%3F">EECS</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://computing.si.umich.edu/confluence/display/SIC/Personal+People+Site">School of Information</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>This tutorial is for making a site on the general UM server(IT)</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Open the terminal and type in "ssh sftp.itd.umich.edu" always without quotes for every step.
      Also, if you have a CAEN account, "ssh uniqename@login.engin.umich.edu" works too.</li>

    <li>Go to the folder where the file is stored. Type in "cd Public/html". Type in "ls" to check what files are
    in this folder, currently it should only contain index.html.</li>

    <li>To open the file, one way is to use vim, it is easy to get trapped if you are a first time user (careful!).
    Type in "vim index.html" to enter the file and edit it.</li>

    <li>To start editing, type in "i" and delete all the default text. Write in the file using HTML syntax.</li>

    <li>To stop editing, press the esc button, then type ":", "w", and "q" to leave the file.</li>

    <li>To publish the site, type "chmod -R a+rX ~/Public/html".</li>

    <li>Check your new site at http://www.umich.edu/~uniqname/</li>
</ol>
